# Process 

This document describes the intended process for contributing and managing reports and documents in this repository. 

Because we, as a group, use GitHub as our main mode of work we want to assure that there is a clear process for progressing work without having to wait for meetings to occur. This describes that process.  

## Reports 

Reports refer to documents that record the concensus and decisions that we reach in our meetings and our various places the group manages contributions. These should go through concensus calls in meetings and then be altered via PRs in this repository. Once a PR is put together, following a meeting decision, it should be marked as `call-for-consensus` via that label. At this point it is up for group members to review the PR and assure that it accurately represents the decision. At two weeks after the label is added to the PR, it is expected that the PR will be merged into the report. If there is additional conversation needed, it can be re-added to the agenda by adding the `agenda+` label in this repository and opening an `agenda+` issue on the meetings repository.

## Documents 

Documents refers to documents managed by an editor or an editorial group. It is expected that editorially managed documents will be worked on by the editorial group, managed by one or more editors, and consistently worked on outside of the meetings. Editors can and should merge in changes and contributions from their group as they develop a draft document. Once the document is well developed or comes to a point that the editor judges needs additional review, the editor can bring that Document to the larger community group via an `agenda+` issue on the meetings repository. If there is need to manage the PRs around a document to build an agreement in the editorial group, they can use the `Merge Pending` label to inform editorial group members of PRs that are ready to be merged. We don't expect `call-for-consensus` to be applied to documents as they have a seperate process through their editorial group to author changes. 

## Using Labels 

Each Report or Document has its own label with the color-code `#BFDADC`. There should only be one Report or Document label on an issue or PR. Each issue or PR should be labled with the Report or Document it corresponds to for clarity and ease of organization. 

Labels each have a description with details on what they are for, you can check them [here](https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/labels). 

### Call for Consensus

When a `call-for-consensus` label is applied without an `agenda+` label it is expected that the PR will be merged in 2 weeks from the label's date of application (visible in the PR). 

### Enhancement 

Enhancement indicates a need for changes to access or (this) process for this repository. Tag an issue with `enhancement` if it has to do with getting access or permissions to this repository. 

### Others 

Other labels should be understood via the [label description](https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/labels)https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/labels or are believed to be clear via their name. 

## Editors
