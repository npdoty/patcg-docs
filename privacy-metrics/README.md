## Privacy Metrics Task Force

Comparable Privacy Metrics: Defining Empirical Privacy

Numerous mechanisms, such as differential privacy and k-anonymity, have been developed to safeguard sensitive data. Within PATCG and across the various private attribution solutions, both proposed and implemented, we’ve seen a number of proposals employing different techniques to create user privacy.  While each method offers unique protection mechanisms, comparing their efficacy in real-world scenarios remains challenging. The distinct nuances of each can make it hard to understand the tradeoffs we may be making in privacy or utility. This highlights the need for a way to consistently evaluate and compare the privacy levels across different methods. Our Task Force goal is to investigate, develop and compare metrics for measuring the privacy-loss of Ad Measurement systems.

In summary, our goal is to develop empirical privacy metrics that should:
1. Provide a clear and intuitive explanation of the privacy we’ve created, making it more comprehensible for all stakeholders.
2. Offer a standardized metric or framework for evaluating the efficacy of different privacy models in real-world scenarios and under specific threat models
3. Facilitate easier comparisons between various protection mechanisms, assisting in choosing the most appropriate model and parameters for datasets.
4. Promote transparency in the application of privacy measures, ensuring that all users can understand and trust the privacy protections in place.
