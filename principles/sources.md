Legislation, regulation and governmental principles in different jurisdictions may also be relevant inputs for potential areas to look at, although they don't specifically direct our global standards work:

[EU Digital Services Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en) includes restrictions on targeting online advertising and requirements for transparency and control

[EU General Data Protection Regulation](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations_en) includes principles applying to personal data processed by an organization

[OECD Guidelines Governing The Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0188) includes principles

Some advertising industry self-regulatory programs may have relevant advertising-specific principles:

[DAA Self-Regulatory Principles](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles) includes self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising (2009), and applications to some other categories
