      Privacy is essential to the sustainable success of the advertising ecosystem. This document takes up the
      W3C TAG's <em>Privacy Principles</em> [[?Privacy-Principles]] and specialises them for advertising-related
      situations.

      This document is a draft of the Private Ad Technologies Community Group, it is intended to be contributed
      to an eventual Private Ad Technologies Working Group on the Note Track. This document does not yet
      reflect the consensus of the PATCG.

    <h2>How This Document Fits In</h2>
    <p>
      This document elaborates on the W3C TAG's <em>Privacy Principles</em> [[?Privacy-Principles]]. The latter
      document is intended to describe principles of privacy that apply across the Web, and therefore leaves the
      door open to a variety of approaches so that different use cases can be approached with some flexibility.
      This document is therefore more specific in detailing how the Web's broader privacy principles are to be
      understood in an advertising context.

    <h2>Advertising-Specific Principles</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Consent Is Inappropriate</h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Principles leave mention that people can consent to some kinds of data processing, but expresses
        scepticism that consent is a valid mechanism to protect people's autonomy in a number of sitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, when the cross-context sharing of identifiers and of behavioural data is involved, the evidence
        shows that no consent mechanism will support people in making autonomous choices.
