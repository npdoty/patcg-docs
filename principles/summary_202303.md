### Some Privacy Principles (W3C TAG Draft Note) to elaborate on

#### context / identity

> A user agent should help its user present the identity they want in each context they are in.

#### minimization

> Sites, user agents, and other actors should minimize the amount of personal data they transfer between actors on the Web.

> Web APIs should be designed to minimize the amount of data that sites need to request to carry out their users' goals and provide granularity and user controls over personal data that is communicated to sites.

> In maintaining duties of protection, discretion and loyalty, user agents should share data only when it either is needed to satisfy a user's immediate goals or aligns with the user's wishes and interests.

#### general preferences

> Sites and user agents should seek to understand and respect people's goals and preferences about use of data about them.

> Specifications that define functionality for telemetry and analytics should explicitly note the telemetry and analytics use to facilitate modal or general user choices.

#### intrusion

> User agents and other actors should take steps to ensure that their user is not exposed to unwanted information.

> A user agent should help users control notifications and other interruptive UI that can be used to manipulate behavior.

> Web sites should use notifications only for information that their users have specifically requested.

## How this fits in

* Helping to guide and evaluate private advertising technology proposals

> This document elaborates on the W3C TAG's Privacy Principles [Privacy-Principles]. The latter document is intended to describe principles of privacy that apply across the Web, and therefore leaves the door open to a variety of approaches so that different use cases can be approached with some flexibility. This document is therefore more specific in detailing how the Web's broader privacy principles are to be understood in an advertising context.
